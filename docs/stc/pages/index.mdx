title: "STC: Speedy type checker"
---

The fastest TypeScript type checker written in Rust. [This project is offically abandoned.](https://github.com/dudykr/stc/issues/1101)

## Status

`stc` is under active development.
To provide an estimate of the progress, we provide historical statistics.

- <strong>Required</strong> means a true negative, which is a type error that is
  not reported by `stc`.

- <strong>Matched</strong> means a true positive, which is a type error that is reported
  by `stc` and correct.

- <strong>Extra</strong> means a false positive. In other words, it's the number
  of incorrect errors `stc` emits while it should not.

- <strong>Panic</strong> means the analyzer panicked while validating input files,
  due to a logic bug.
