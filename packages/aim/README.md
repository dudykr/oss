# aim: AI Usage Monitor

Port of [`ccusage_monitor`](https://github.com/Maciek-roboblog/Claude-Code-Usage-Monitor) to TypeScript, just because I think the node package manager makes using it easier.

The original `ccusage_monitor` is a MIT-licensed Python project.

## Usage

```bash
# Via npx
npx @dudykr/aim

# Via pnpm
pnpm dlx @dudykr/aim
```
